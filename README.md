- 👋 Hi, I’m Kazume
- 👀 I'm interested in many things like web development, programming simple projects in C# and Python, also i want to expand my knowledge of cybersecurity and learning new things about programming and my mistakes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C in university but in my spare time I learn Python and webdev with linux from my programming courses.
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate with someone who can help me develop my IT experience and help me better understand programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: Currently I do not have any expectable social media, so you can contact me on github or in discord - Kazumenda
